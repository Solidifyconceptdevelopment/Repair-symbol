# Repair symbol
An open source repair symbol, inspired by the recycle symbol

Repairing is better than recycling, so it should have it's own symbol. You're free to use it for your projects, repair shop, designs, ...

All logos and icons are available in different sizes (PNG) or vector format (SVG)

Color options are full color, greyscale or black.
